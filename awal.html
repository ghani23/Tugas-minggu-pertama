    <h4><b>Fact about Muhammad Al-Fatih</b></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mehmed continued his conquests in Anatolia with its reunification and in Southeast Europe as far west as Bosnia.</li>
        <li>He is considered a hero in modern-day Turkey and parts of the wider Muslim world.</li>
        <li>Mehmed II was born on March 30, 1432, in Edirne, then the capital city of the Ottoman state.</li>
        <li>The influence of Akshamsaddin in Mehmed’s life became predominant from a young age, especially in the imperative of fulfilling his Islamic duty to overthrow the Byzantine empire by conquering Constantinople.</li>
        <li>Around the grand mosque that he constructed, he erected eight madrasas, which, for nearly a century, kept their rank as the highest teaching institutions of the Islamic sciences in the empire.</li>
        <li>Mehmed II allowed his subjects a considerable degree of religious freedom, provided they were obedient to his rule.</li>
        <li>Within Constantinople, Mehmed established a millet, or an autonomous religious community, and appointed the former Patriarch Gennadius Scholarius as a religious leader for the Orthodox Christians of the city.</li>
        <li>Mehmed was the first sultan who was able to codify and implement kanunname solely based on his own independent authority.</li>
